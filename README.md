# WP-JavaScript
Research into authoring WordPress pages using JavaScript 

This is one of several research and development projects I pursue at my Bible.MichaelKentBurns.com site.

I have several other projects that are Node.js JavaScript packages. 
This particular project is an effort to integrate those projects into my main R&D WordPress site.

## Setup

	* change directory to your WordPress install's public_html directory
	* Install gh from ?? 
	* Install Node.js
	* Install nvm
	* Clone this repository:  git clone https://github.com/MichaelKentBurns/WP-JavaScript.git
	* Consult this required Node package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/wpapi (already configured as a requirement).
